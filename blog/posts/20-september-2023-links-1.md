1. Nate Silver on [the Indigo Blob](https://www.natesilver.net/p/twitter-elon-and-the-indigo-blob)
2. [A Portrait of Tenochtitlan:](https://tenochtitlan.thomaskole.nl/) a 3D reconstruction of the capital of the Aztec Empire
3. [Does history have a replication crisis?](https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/p/age-of-invention-does-history-have)

8. [High-speed AI drone beats world-champion racers for the first time](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/high-speed-ai-drone-beats-world-champion-racers-for-the-first-time/).

9. Cool [animated data visualization](https://twitter.com/SteveStuWill/status/1687533903601709056) showing global progress over the last century

# Business update, week 26
#### January 18, 2026 at 9:51 AM

Hi Everyone,

Since the last update I:

- Created daily educational posts on LinkedIn
- Thought about how to improve my outreach strategy for next week
- Gained my first client for the career mentorship program

To recap my high-level growth plan:

1. I post useful, education robotics stuff on LinkedIn (and eventually other platforms)
2. I build a large following among robotics people
3. Some of those people visit and use the Robotics Prep website
4. Some of the website visitors sign up for the mentor program or practice interviews

My first goal for this week was to create some kind of educational robotics post for LinkedIn each weekday. I didn’t have an overarching plan for what each post would be about entering the week, but in the process of creating the first few, I figured out a formula I’ll use for the next few weeks. This week’s posts included:

**M:** Kinematic bicycle model explainer (part 1)

**Tu:** Coding challenge prompt, with a video demoing a working solution

**W:** Explanation of terminology related to robot motion

**Th:** Kinematic bicycle model explainer (part 2)

**Fri:** Practice interview questions

Here's an example of the style of post I've been creating:

Most of the posts were connected to the same topic (modeling the motion of a vehicle). This week I was sort of figuring that out as I went - for next week, I’m going to pick a topic up front, plan out all the posts, and will also try to create them all in one go, rather than one per day.

While this week my focus was on producing a post each day, my focus for the next week will be improving the reach of those posts. To do that, I’m going to try the following strategies:

- The 5 weekly posts will all be connected and cover the same, specific robotics topic. I’ll label the posts to indicate the order in the sequence. These will be posted to the company page
- I’ll make multiple posts from my personal account summarizing what the topic is for the week and including an interesting visual - ChatGPT says that company pages are not favored by the LinkedIn algorithm and that early on, most of the outreach should come from a personal account. I’ll mention the company / company page in the posts and hopefully direct some of the traffic there
- I will proactively connect with robotics engineers on LinkedIn and try to build my network through ‘brute force’
- I will comment on posts of other robotics-related users or businesses (if I have something thoughtful to add, not just ‘nice post’)

If I stick to all of those things, I think I’ll see a big boost in traffic. My goal is to double the number of impressions I hit last week.

The other update from the week is that I had someone sign up for the mentorship program! I start working with them this week. So I will be spending some of my time this week working with that client. Hopefully I will have more to say about what I’m learning from the mentorship part of the business sometime soon.

Here are the stats for the week:

Until next week,

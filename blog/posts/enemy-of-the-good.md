Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

I love this saying.

So many of my projects have died because I got carried away planning something extremely elaborate, became overwhelmed by the amount of work, tabled the project, and then never came back to it.

The elaborate versions really would have been great. But an average version that actually existed would have been much better than what we got.

When I have an idea for a new project now, I try to figure out what the 2-hour version of the project is. I operate under the assumption that I’m going to stop caring about that thing in about 2 hours. That’s how much time there is to keep the idea off my mental list of “great ideas that never went anywhere”. That list haunts me and makes me doubt if I’ll ever finish **anything**.

It’s pretty easy to turn a 2-hour version into a 4-hour version, a 4-hour version into a 1-day version, a 1-day version into a 2-day version, and so on…

It’s really hard to turn a brief moment of inspiration into a 2-day version.

I’ve wanted to start a blog for at least 5 years. I started building a website for my blog twice before today. Both times, I went for the 2-week version right off the bat. Needless to say, when I woke up this morning, I still did not have a blog.

But before I go to sleep tonight, this post will be on my blog.

First, start.

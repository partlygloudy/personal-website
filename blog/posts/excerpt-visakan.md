# Excerpt, 'Letter to a Young Songwriter'
#### Tuesday, June 6 at 5:30 PM

From Visakan Veerasamy's *[Letter To A Young Songwriter](https://visakanv.com/1000/0152-letter-to-a-young-songwriter/)* which I very randomly stumbled across today:

> Just write a song. Make it as stupid and silly as you can. Finish it. Allow it to be a little strange, weird and rough around the edges. In fact, go especially out of your way to try and write the worst song ever. Then try and top that with something even worse, if possible. It’s hard to find good ideas when you’re looking for good ideas, but you can sometimes find them just next door when you’re looking for bad ideas.

> When you’ve written a hundred songs, you’ll look back and realize that you’ve learnt things that you couldn't possibly have anticipated when you were starting out. I haven’t written a hundred songs, but this is my experience with writing blogposts, and I imagine songs are no different. Quantity has a quality all of its own.

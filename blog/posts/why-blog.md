# Why I’m Blogging
#### June 30, 2023 at 10:49 PM

- I sometimes  have thoughts or ideas I want to share with people
- I want to understand the world better, and writing about things is a good way ([maybe necessary?](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html)) to understand them better. It’s hard to explain things clearly if you don’t understand them well
- I see things online every day that I think are worth sharing, and I really don’t like posting on Twitter (and most people aren't on Twitter)
- I want to find other people that share my interests and writing about what I’m interested in on the internet could help with that
- I like making cool visual / interactive stuff with HTML/CSS/Javascript and sometimes want to share it
- I get excited about stuff and blogging is an outlet for that enthusiasm!
- If I haven’t been creating much for a while, I can get stuck in a motivational rut that takes a lot of time and effort to get out of. A habit of regular creation, like blogging, might help me avoid this.
- I’m not positive, but I think [this post by Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/) was what first sparked my interest in blogging \[I read it again for the first time in a while just now, and wow, it definitely still holds up!\]
- “I wish I had a blog set up, I’d really like to write about X” is a thought that I’ve had regularly for about 4 or 5 years now. Clearly I need to at least give it a go!

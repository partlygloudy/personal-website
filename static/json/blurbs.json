  "about": [
    "Hi, I'm Jake. I'm an engineer by training, have dabbled in blogging and forecasting, and am currently working to start my first business. I like to learn about the world and strive to solve hard problems to make life better for people. My dream is to spend my time on futuristic deep tech problems like nuclear fusion, cultivated meat production, and planet-scale carbon removal.",
    "I currently run a monthly history book club in Arlington/DC and am trying to learn Spanish, but mostly am spending my time on starting a business. If you're interested in my work or there's something I can help with, please reach out!"
